        <h2>Merry Not-Quite-Christmas!</h2>

        Was I a day late? In my opinion, if a holiday is really all that important then it should
        take place on a day that's a multiple of 13. So I henceforth declare a new holiday, Alfmas,
        which celebrates the day Geetanshi drove around Berkeley (and specifically drove down Dwight Way way too many times)
        delivering presents in her magical sleigh/Kia Forte.

        The past week I've felt very far away from you, both physically (lol) and emotionally. Part of the feeling is obvious; it's something that comes with
        not talking to someone you've talked to nearly every day of the past 3 months. But I think I've also felt this incomplete completeness--being with my friends every
        waking minute, every sleeping minute, you start to feel immersed in the punchlines without setups, the quotes without context, the Togetherness that I think is unique to a group
        of very different people who come from very different places. And it fills me up with Chicken Soup for the soul, but it also doesn't leave much room for other people in my life,
        and I've found I haven't had much time to think about you or us or what it means to have made it through this semester.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        We made it through this semester. And however many hours of sleep and however much dignity and humanity we feel may have been
        stripped from us in the process, no one can take away the fact that we made it through this fucking semester. I'm left feeling utterly exhausted, to be
        totally honest. Yes it is the general sleep-deprivation of the last week talking, but also a deeper kind of exhausted, one that you don't really understand until
        you have a chance to recover (and I am well on the way to recovering--the bookstores and adventures and time spent with LeuLeu are seeing to that). 
        While I'm still living in this tiredness, though, I want to appreciate some of it.
        Is it deeply shitty and wrong to try and weave a moral out of some of our harder days, longer nights, scarier hours? 
        Something in my gut says it is, and I'm sorry if this is trivializing or hurtful. <br>
        But I feel like this semester challenged me to be a better person, and you inspired me to be a better person. I feel like, in trying to
        be the friend that you deserve and need, I've been able to clean up the messes of myself that I long ago gave up on.
        <br/>
        You've made me a better person. And I couldn't ask for a better Christmas present. 
        <br/>
        <br/>

        <br/>
        <br/>
        PS I did really like the present you got for me. That along with a kitchen scale my Mom's boyfriend got me will do wonders for my baking next semester :) Macarons round 4 let's get it.

          And here is the poem:
          <div class="poem">
            The (Deep) Dish that Almost Broke Me<br/>
            <br/>

There I was in ORD<br/>
Waiting for my flight to leave<br/>
Literally on the middle leg of my trip from Seattle to Chicago to London and<br/>
Emotionally on the last.<br/>
I had a 90-minute layover,<br/>
90 minutes to pee, drink, stretch my legs and relax<br/>
But wait--<br/>
There was a 20-minute taxi after landing<br/>
90 minutes to 70 minutes<br/>
But wait--<br/>
There was a 10-minute walk out of the plane to the terminal in zero degrees C<br/>
C for Chicago<br/>
70 minutes to 60 minutes<br/>
But wait--<br/>
I had to claim my bag<br/>
60 minutes to 55<br/>
But wait--<br/>
My flight to London was delayed, which meant I had to sit on my<br/>
Butt and wait.<br/>

So there I was in ORD<br/>
And baking right in front of me<br/>
Was a deep-dish pizza stand. And<br/>
I was hungry cuz I hadn’t eaten since 10. <br/>
Now it was six, plus the time change makes nine,<br/>
Nine reasons I’d become a vegetarian popped into my head<br/>
While I looked at that deep dish pizza stand and<br/>
The pepperoni pies it was shelling out.<br/>
I could smell the grease, not the greasy kind of grease but the<br/>
Sexy kind.<br/>
Forget automatic, forget systematic, forget hydromatic, this<br/>
Pizza smelled like it could keep your motor running and your engine gunning for a whole<br/>
Twelve-hour flight across the Atlantic.<br/>
When the coins slid from the silver oven to the teal boxes<br/>
I could see the melted cheese,<br/>
Like dollops of 24 carats dripping from a goldsmith’s pot.<br/>
<br/>
I ran through the six-plus-three-makes nine reasons I became a vegetarian.<br/>
One. Uh. Number one. Uhhhh--<br/>
Something I realized while waiting in Chicago O’Hare:<br/>
It’s kind of hard to listen to reason when your stomach is rumbling so loud.<br/>
The human body is a fragile, culpable thing<br/>
That can only go so long for so far<br/>
And so far for so long<br/>
<br/>
In the end<br/>
Delta made my choice for me--<br/>
Flight 9090 non-stop to London<br/>
Now boarding Group Four--<br/>
I got on that plane,<br/>
In so so much pain<br/>
And 20 minutes later<br/>
I was off.<br/>
<br/>
But I left my stomach in Chicago<br/>
And one day, I’ll have to go back and get it.<br/>
