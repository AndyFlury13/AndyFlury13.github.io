        <h2>Happy Birthday, Geetanshi!</h2>

        Finally old enough to say "yes" when they offer you red wine in Seattle ;)<br>
        Though I usually detest my own birthday I've started looking at them in a new light. Each
        of my friends' birthdays is a chance for me to think about how much I appreciate them and
        wrack my brain for a way to thank them--which invariably fails because how can any finite gift
        compare to the infinite and infinitesimal experience of being with someone you care about?
        This was initially going to be a really messy Baymax-themed website/card but Lord knows the past 72 hours
        have aged me so I hope you enjoy this slightly tamer version.<br>
        Speaking of Baymax, I hope you got...something out of the "macarons".
        Hopefully a laugh? Hopefully not indigestion. I will say that trying to make them has increased my respect
        for you tenfold because What. The. Heck. They are so much harder to make than I remember. How are macarons not a gazillion dollars.
        <br>
        The first idea I had for a gift was something The Infernal Devices related, maybe something involved with Cassandra Clare, or Will Herondale...
        so naturally I forced a neural network to read the entire series and spit out a happy birthday message! My computer worked for 15 hours and the result was
        not particularly impressive but I thought you might enjoy a snippet:


        <div class="bigQuote">
          "
        </div>
        <div class="tidQuotes">
          <p>“<b>Shadowhunters</b>. The Clave is just a most bizarre sort.” Nate spat as Will and Miss automaton, at that moment. His and his lips were stained with fury. “Let me be very happy.”</p>
<p>At that, Charlote saw that there was something there, at the foot of her dress.</p>
<p>“Happy Birthday, Geetanshi!” She shook her head. “Happy Birthday, Geetanshi!”</p>
<p>“Cecy,” Will said, her vision tightened around her teeth, illuminating her as his own.</p>
<p>“Happy Birthday, Geetanshi!”</p>
<p>“Happy Birthday, Geetanshi!”</p>
<p>“No.” Will leaned closer. His silvery eyes were gray-black, set through her Yorkshire arm as they ducked into a shard of pain in his white shirt, ended it out of Miranda’s neck, and his cat veins came ahead, but through the bank before one of her spine.<p>
        </div>
        <div class="bigQuote2">
          "
        </div>

        Not super intelligible, but hey. Sometimes Cassandra Clare isn't the most intelligble either.
        More than anything, I hope you had a wonderful birthday spent with the people you love.

        PS yes I know this is the most EECS Boi way to make a card and I apologize for that!!
        <br/>
        <br/>
        PSS Here are some pictures that remind of you. I've found that I've been seeing you in
        different places in Berkeley, hearing your voice when someone plays Canon in D on the Sproul piano, wondering what you'd think of a library or a book cover. And it makes me happy, having all these Geetanshi-impressions around.
